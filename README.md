# Hi
This is my first try to write a shell.   
Thanks a lot to fht for everything!   

### test.sh
My very first shell - there's just an echo, in fact.

### checkConnection.sh
A shell to check whether the fq service is all right.   
And if not, send a mail to inform me and fht.   

### msg.txt
We use ssmtp to send the mail.
